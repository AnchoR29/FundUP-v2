This is the design template to be used for our website, along with the MySQL database "wordpress.sql"

Use these files when creating your respective parts for the project.
I expect you to take into account the dynamic web pages to be produced concerning your parts.
Use the Preliminary UI Design of the first project report as a guide on the content layout of your parts.
Make full use of the customization categories.
You may also use plugins, but take note of the added tables and data. When deleting plugins, some tables and data don't get deleted.
(Suggestion: Keep a clean version of the database before you edit)

Lastly, use this readme file to list down the plugins you used, along with the tables added.
Happy coding. :)

* For the home page, it should contain Featured Projects and Latest Projects.
* Raise urgent concerns in the group chat. I can entertain them on Saturday night (September 16) onwards.
